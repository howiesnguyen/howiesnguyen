https://github.com/IBM/kafka-data-streaming-app-example - An example of data streaming application with Kafka, in which an application generates and publishes random numbers to Kafka, and then those numbers are read from Kafka and displayed by a web-based dashboard. The example includes the components: the random number emitter service, the dashboard backend, the dashboard frontend, and the notification service. The frontend is a ReactJS-based web application, it doesn't communicate with Kafka directly, instead it will receive data via the dashboard backend using Server-Sent Events (SSE). The random number emitter service is written in Java using Kafka Clients API directly. While the other dashboard backend is based on Spring framework, and uses the spring-kafka library.
